# POS_UML
POS system for the RiverHawk Cafe @UML

SENIOR CAPSTONE PROJECT:
This POS System was made using Visual Basic and Excel as our Database. 
This is a Point of Sale System as well as an Inventory Management System. 
It will track and automatically update the Inventory as needed. 
The Customer will only have to worry about ordering/updating the inventory with new orders.
*If the system was implemented we could have added a self-ordering/updating mechanism to the system as well.
